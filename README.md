# Event Management API
### Project Overview
This is a backend system that allows people to create, manage, and participate in events. Think of it as the engine behind apps like Eventbrite or Meetup — but simplified. It helps users to:
- Register and log in.
- Create events (e.g., workshops, concerts, meetings).
- View and search for events.
- Book or reserve spots in events.
- Get information about event venues or locations.</br>

This system doesn’t include a user interface (like a mobile app or website), but it powers one through its API endpoints — which are just digital doors through which apps talk to the system.
